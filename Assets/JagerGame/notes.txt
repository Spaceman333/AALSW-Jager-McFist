.Consider alt player char from Warped pack.
.New player model that skates instead of walking (Armored Core). (done, with existing tho.)
.First VR level context "lets test out the specs of this new model adapted for this planetary conditions".
-(player is familiarized with the full capabilities of the body, emphasized to expect no upgrades after it)
-(VR test level focuses on showing the extremes that the body is capable of, letting the player know their limits & potential)
.Tileset order is this: Main - Fill - Spice - BG
.Consider multi-camera head so that 360 aiming isn't so wierd.
(when player rotates arms to aim anywhere in the 180' region behind them, the player doesn't flip with the cursor so the arms just spin all the way back... in a way that is impossible for a human. I want 360 aiming at all times, so perharps a different style head that has cameras facing all directions is needed here. Either a glass dome head (lacks personality imo) or a multiple direction eyes orb (kinda wierd, but cool i think?))
.For the smartgun expansion sheet, add shoulder mounted megalaser cannons (slayer thermal destroyer) and gigacannons (ridiculous slabs of giant guns)
.Remember that Melee weapons are projectile based so that crosshair and free directional aim is preserved!
